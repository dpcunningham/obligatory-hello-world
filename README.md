# obligatory-hello-world
The obligatory "hello world"  exercise.  I beseech the gods:  Let this NOT be as bad as CVS or SVN.   ;-)

The ["Hello World"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) exercise is a time-honored way to initiate yourself in any new language or toolset.  We follow the steps of the exercise here iin this repository...

Notes: 

- By instinct, I tend to slap a (sortable) date-suffix onto my branches.  This is an old CVS habit, born out of many SNAFUs.  I don't know if it's actually neccesary in git/GitHub.  I suppose it's like setting the parking brake in a level driveway, even though your car is in park.  :-) 
- This may be useful for beginners: the "md" suffix on this `README.md` file indicates it's a "markdown" file. Here's a useful "beginner's guide" to the [specific markdown dialog](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) used on GitHb.
